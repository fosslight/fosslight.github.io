The [release note](https://github.com/fosslight/fosslight/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md) has been added so that you can check it by clicking the release version under the logo in the upper left corner of FOSSLight Hub. In the release note, you can check the release date, new features, changed features, fixed issues, and deprecated features for each release version.
