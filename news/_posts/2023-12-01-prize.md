On December 1, 2023, LG Electronics was recognized for its contributions to the development of the domestic open source software (OSS) industry by receiving the Minister of Science and ICT Award at the '2023 Domestic Open Source Software Industry Development Contributors Award Ceremony.' This award acknowledges LG Electronics' active participation in the OSS community and the development and release of its own OSS management tools, FOSSLight Hub and FOSSLight Scanner.

The recognition comes as a result of LG Electronics' significant contributions to the domestic OSS industry through FOSSLight. FOSSLight is a tool that supports license management and security vulnerability analysis for open source software. By making FOSSLight publicly available, LG Electronics has enabled many companies and developers to utilize open source software more efficiently.

LG Electronics recognizes the importance of open source software and has been fulfilling its role as a proactive user and contributor. Through FOSSLight, the company has achieved transparent management and enhanced security of open source software, thereby contributing to the competitiveness of the domestic software industry.

An LG Electronics FOSSLight developer stated, "We will continue to collaborate with the open source software community to promote the ongoing development of open source software and strengthen the competitiveness of the domestic software industry."
