FOSSLight CLI 1.0 has been released. 
FOSSLight CLI allows you to use the features of the browser-based FOSSLight Hub directly from the terminal command prompt.
With it, you can check open source licenses, view information about each open source, and identify security vulnerabilities,
as well as automate the open source compliance process.
For example, you can create automation tasks through YAML files, run scanners, 
and directly upload the results to your FOSSLight Hub project.

You can find the usage guide on the [FOSSLight CLI GitHub](https://github.com/fosslight/fosslight_cli/blob/develop/README.md). 
This 1.0 release is the first version of FOSSLight CLI and will be continuously updated to match changes in Hub features. 
It can also be used with the FOSSLight Hub v2.0.1.pre-release version.

Enhance the efficiency of your open source management with FOSSLight CLI 1.0!
