We are excited to announce the release of 
[v2.0.0.pre-release](https://github.com/fosslight/fosslight/releases/tag/v2.0.0.pre-release) 
to give you an early look at the new UI 2.0. 
This update introduces numerous changes aimed at significantly enhancing the user experience.


### Intuitive Design and Consistency, Transition to Thymeleaf Framework

With UI 2.0, the overall UI scenario has been revamped. 
The new UI is designed to allow users to quickly grasp the status of their projects at a glance. 
We have also focused on ensuring consistency in the UI to make it easier for users to understand and use.
Thanks to the unified design and intuitive layout, users can easily find the information they need without going through complicated processes.
This approach is expected to greatly improve user satisfaction. 

Additionally, the UI 2.0 has transitioned from the previous framework to Thymeleaf. 
Please note this change if you are using the earlier version of Fosslight Hub.


### Release of API V2

Along with this update, the new API V2 has also been released. 
API V2 adheres to RESTful API principles, 
enhancing usability and scalability to provide developers with a superior user experience.


### User-Centric Lite Web

For the first time, we are introducing the user-centric Lite Web.
The existing Hub considers both administrators and users, handling the entire OSC process, 
which may feel complex for first-time users due to its extensive functionalities. 
However, Lite Web is designed from the user's perspective to be simple and lightweight, 
allowing general users to utilize its features more easily.

We are thrilled to offer an improved user experience with UI 2.0. 
We promise to continue delivering enhanced and evolving services. We look forward to your continued interest and feedback.
