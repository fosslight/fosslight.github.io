On July 13, 2024, the Contribution Academy officially commenced its activities with an inaugural ceremony. This year's academy has garnered significant attention with the participation of FOSSLight Scanner, an open source software scanner. FOSSLight Scanner is a tool designed to analyze the licenses and security vulnerabilities of open source software, and it is set to showcase enhanced features and performance during the academy.

Notably, mentors Soim Kim and Kyeongae Kim, who have extensive knowledge and experience in the development and utilization of FOSSLight Scanner, will be providing practical assistance to the participants. Mentor Soim Kim stated, "I hope to help many developers effectively use and develop FOSSLight Scanner through the academy." Mentor Kyoungae Kim also expressed, "I expect participants to learn how to contribute to open-source projects using FOSSLight Scanner and, through this, create a better software ecosystem."

The Contribution Academy is a program aimed at increasing understanding of open-source software and providing developers with opportunities to contribute to real projects. Following the inaugural ceremony, various workshops, and seminars are scheduled to take place, offering participants the chance to gain practical experience and knowledge.
