**FOSSLight Hub 2.1.1 is Released!**


This version addresses various issues found in 2.1.0 and introduces several new features to provide a better user experience.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new in this release:
1. **Important Notes Added to Open Source**
    - Weâ€™ve added the Important Notes feature to provide users with essential information concisely.
2. **Restriction Icons with Traffic Light System**
    - A visual traffic light system has been introduced to easily recognize license and open source restrictions at a glance.
3. **Cargo Package Manager Pre-Review Support**
    - You can now handle Cargo types in Project > Pre-Review.
4. **File Append Support in Notices**
    - Weâ€™ve improved the ability to append items in file format when setting up Notices in Project > Packaging.
5. **API V2 Expansion**
    - The Project Reset/Delete API has been added.
6. **Terminology Change from â€˜Watcherâ€™ to â€˜Editorâ€™**
    - The term 'Watcher' has been changed to 'Editor' to intuitively reflect that users registered as Watchers have editing permissions.

In addition to these updates, we have resolved various issues reported in 2.1.0 and made minor UI changes to enhance usability.
