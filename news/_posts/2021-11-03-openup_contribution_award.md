The Open Source Contribution Academy is a contribution mentoring program for open source developers that has been running for many years.
Two FOSSLight maintainers, Kim Soim and Kim Kyuongae, also participated in the FOSSLight project as mentors in the 2021 Open Source Contribution Program. As a result of collaborating with many mentees and contributing greatly to the FOSSLight project, FOSSLight Project received an encouragement award. Thank you to all the mentors and mentees!
