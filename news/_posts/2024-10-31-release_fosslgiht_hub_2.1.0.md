The latest version of the open-source software license and vulnerability management tool,
**FOSSLight Hub 2.1.0**, has been released.

This update introduces improvements to the **Security** tab, 
enhancing the efficiency of vulnerability management within projects. 
The updated Security tab now offers a **Full Discovered** view, displaying all detected vulnerabilities, 
and a **Need to resolve** filter, which highlights only vulnerabilities that exceed a defined score threshold. 
Additionally, a **Security Comment** column has been added, allowing users to leave notes on each vulnerability.

A new binary list verification feature has also been added to prevent non-source code files from being included 
during the **packaging process**. With the help of **FOSSLight Scanner**, 
project managers can now more easily identify and manage non-source files within projects.

In addition, various bugs from version 2.0.2 have been fixed, 
including improvements to vulnerability matching and packaging verification, enabling more precise results.

For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the 
[Release Notes](https://github.com/fosslight/fosslight/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md#210-2024-10-31).

This update is expected to be particularly valuable for users who actively utilize the Security tab.
Weâ€™re excited to continue improving FOSSLight Hubâ€™s stability 
and look forward to your ongoing interest and support. ðŸš€
