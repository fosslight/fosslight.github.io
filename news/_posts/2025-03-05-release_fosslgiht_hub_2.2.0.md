The Fosslight Hub version 2.2.0 has been released. This update includes new features and several improvements.


**‚≠êÔ∏è3rd Party**  
The "3rd Party Information" and "3rd Party Identification" have been separated into distinct tabs.This makes it easier for users to find 3rd party information and OSS details in the BOM tab.Additionally, a new feature called 3rd Party BOM Compare has been added, allowing users to compare different BOMs.

**‚≠êÔ∏èProject**  
A "change status" feature has been added, allowing users to update the status of multiple projects at the same time. The conditions for BOM merging have been modified, making it easier to manage obligations based on different licenses.

**‚≠êÔ∏èLicense**  
The system now allows for the storage of null values in the License text field and the initial display of the list has been updated to sort items in descending order based on the modified date.



**‚≠êÔ∏èReview Report**  
The display of 'OSS Important Notes' information has been improved, and links have been provided for both OSS and License names, allowing users to navigate to detailed screens. This enhancement significantly increases the accessibility of information.

**‚≠êÔ∏èOpen Source**  
The renaming of OSS can now only be done on the detailed screen, and users can modify the name solely through the edit button. This makes the process of changing both the nickname and the full version name clearer. Additionally, the initial display of the list is now sorted in descending order based on the modified date.
