FOSSLight project participated in 2023 [Open Source Contribution Academy](https://www.contribution.ac/).
The Open Source Contribution Academy is a contribution mentoring program where you can break down entry barriers to open source and experience the open source culture of participating, open, sharing, and collaborating with senior developers by supporting each other's 'contributors'. This is a program that has been running steadily for many years.
[Dabeen Jeong](https://github.com/70825) and [Jongwoo Han](https://github.com/jongwooo), who were FOSSLight's mentees last year, and maintainers [Kyoungae Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyoungae-kim-597a1630/) and [Soim Kim](https://github.com/soimkim) served as mentors.
As a result of the four mentors and many mentees actively participating and contributing regardless of location, online and offline, we were awarded the **President of Korea IT Business Promotion Association**. Congratulations to all mentors and mentees!!
